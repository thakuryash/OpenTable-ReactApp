1) I have spend about 1 hours to complete the coding test. If i had more time i would complete all the requested requirements as well build the project using REACT/REDUX with more functionality.

2) ES6 Template literals : output += `<div class="list-items"><ul><li>Name: ${user.name}</li><li>Address: ${user.address}</li><li>Price: ${user.price}</li></ul></div>`;

3) I would find the issue by debugging, create a git branch, fix the issue in that branch, do regression testing and then merge with master

4) I would improve the API that i used in my test by making sure all the data is showing correctly if not redirect the user to the choose another restaurant. For example: Some of the URL links to the open table app were throwing error.
